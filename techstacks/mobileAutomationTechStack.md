# Mobile Automation Tech stack POC

In this documnet we went throght different engines, frameworks, clouds and languages which are there and are widely used in mobile automation. We are comparing them side by side and finalizing the tools which are best for us as per our requirements which are:

- framework should be compatible for a white label application
- it should support cross platform (iOS and android)
- should work well with clouds like browserstack etc
- should support parallelization
- flexibilty for visual tests
- should support our team's tech compitancy which is js/ts based

## Framework engine Comparison Table

| Framework | Platforms Supported | Languages Supported | Community Support | CI/CD Integration | Execution Speed | Visual Testing Support |

| **Appium** | ✅ iOS + ✅ Android + 🌐 Mobile Web | Java, TypeScript/JS, Python, C#, Ruby, etc. | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Very active | ✅ Excellent — Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Azure, BrowserStack | ⚙️ Medium (WebDriver overhead) | ✅ Excellent — Applitools, Percy, etc. |
| **Espresso** | ✅ Android only | Java, Kotlin | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Official Google support | ✅ Excellent — Gradle, Firebase Test Lab | ⚡ Very fast | ⚙️ Good — via screenshot diff tools, Applitools SDK |
| **XCUITest** | ✅ iOS only | Swift, Objective-C | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Strong Apple ecosystem | ✅ Excellent — Xcode, Jenkins, BrowserStack | ⚡ Very fast | ⚙️ Good — XCTest attachments, Applitools SDK |
| **EarlGrey** | ✅ iOS only | Swift, Objective-C | ⭐⭐⭐ Moderate | ✅ Good — Xcode, Jenkins, CircleCI | ⚡ Very fast | ⚙️ Limited — manual screenshot diff possible |
| **Calabash** | ✅ iOS + ✅ Android | Ruby | ⭐⭐ Mostly deprecated | ⚙️ Average | 🐢 Slow | ❌ Poor — minimal visual integrations |
| **Selendroid** | ✅ Android only | Java, C#, Python, Ruby | ⭐⭐ Legacy, minimal maintenance | ⚙️ Average | 🐢 Slow | ❌ Poor — outdated, no native visual testing |
| **Robotium** | ✅ Android only | Java | ⭐⭐ Small, older community | ⚙️ Average | ⚙️ Moderate | ❌ Poor — no modern visual testing support |
| **NightwatchJS** | ✅ iOS + ✅ Android (via Appium) + 🌐 Web | JavaScript / TypeScript | ⭐⭐⭐ Active JS ecosystem | ✅ Excellent — Node.js CI/CD friendly | ⚙️ Medium (depends on Appium) | ✅ Good — integrates with Applitools/Percy |

## Final Choice (Appium)

After evaluating popular mobile automation frameworks against key criteria — cross-platform support, language flexibility, community support, CI/CD integration, execution speed, and visual testing capabilities — **Appium emerges as the most suitable choice** for our project.

Appium provides:

- **True cross-platform support** (iOS and Android) with a single codebase, reducing duplication and easing maintenance.  
- **Flexibility in programming languages**, allowing our team to leverage TypeScript/JavaScript for both mobile and web automation.  
- **Strong community and ecosystem**, ensuring long-term support, continuous updates, and integration with modern tools like BrowserStack.  
- **Seamless CI/CD and cloud device integration**, enabling parallel test execution and scalability.  
- **Compatibility with visual testing tools** like Applitools and Percy, which is crucial for maintaining white-label UI consistency across brands.

While native frameworks like Espresso and XCUITest offer faster execution and lower flakiness for platform-specific flows, Appium strikes the best balance between **cross-platform maintainability, cloud scalability, and visual verification support**, making it the ideal engine for our modular, white-label mobile application automation strategy.

## Mobile Automation Framework / Runner Comparison

| Framework / Runner | Mobile Automation Support | TypeScript / JS Support | Parallelization | CI/CD Integration | Visual Testing Support | Notes |
|-------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|----------------|------------------|----------------------|-------|
| **WebdriverIO** | ✅ Full (via Appium: iOS + Android + Hybrid) | ✅ Excellent | ✅ Built-in runner support | ✅ BrowserStack, SauceLabs, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Azure | ✅ Applitools, Percy, WDIO image-comparison | Ideal for cross-platform mobile automation; modular architecture; strong TypeScript support |
| **NightwatchJS** | ✅ via Appium (iOS + Android + Hybrid) | ✅ Good | ✅ via Appium driver | ✅ BrowserStack, Jenkins, GitHub Actions | ✅ via Applitools / Percy (JS integration) | Less flexible than WDIO; smaller plugin ecosystem; good for JS teams |
| **Cypress** | ❌ Web only | ✅ Good | ✅ Web only | ✅ Excellent for web CI/CD | ✅ Excellent for web visual testing | Cannot run Appium or native mobile tests; web-only runner |
| **Playwright** | ❌ Web only | ✅ Excellent | ✅ Web only | ✅ Excellent for web CI/CD | ✅ Excellent for web visual testing | Cannot run Appium or native mobile tests; web-only runner |
| **TestNG** | ✅ via Appium (iOS + Android + Hybrid) | ❌ Java only | ✅ Built-in support with suites / parallel execution | ✅ Jenkins, TeamCity, GitHub Actions, Azure | ⚙️ Limited — can integrate with Applitools/third-party libraries | Popular in Java + Appium stacks; widely used in enterprise projects; less modern syntax compared to JS/TS runners |

Based on the data aquired and tabular comparison WebdriverIo and TestNg is the best suitable candidate for our application requirements.

## Appium Test Runner / Framework Comparison: TestNG vs WebdriverIO

| Feature / Metric | **TestNG (Java)** | **WebdriverIO (JS/TS)** | Notes / Recommendation |
|-----------------|-----------------|------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Mobile Automation Support** | ✅ Supports iOS + Android via Appium | ✅ Supports iOS + Android via Appium | Both can drive Appium, but WDIO has a **native Appium service**, making session management and driver setup easier. |
| **Language / Ecosystem** | Java | JavaScript / TypeScript | TestNG works in Java-heavy teams; WDIO is ideal for JS/TS teams and aligns with modern web/mobile stacks. |
| **Parallel Execution** | ✅ Supported via `parallel` suites / threads | ✅ Built-in runner support with parallel workers | WDIO provides **simpler, more scalable parallelization** across cloud device farms. |
| **CI/CD Integration** | ✅ Jenkins, TeamCity, Azure, GitHub Actions | ✅ Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Azure, BrowserStack, SauceLabs | Both integrate well; WDIO has more ready-made cloud integration services (BrowserStack, SauceLabs). |
| **Visual Testing Support** | ⚙️ Limited — requires manual integration with Applitools / Percy | ✅ Excellent — built-in WDIO plugins for Applitools, Percy, WDIO image-comparison | WDIO makes **visual testing seamless**, including baseline management per brand/device. |
| **Reporting** | ✅ Built-in TestNG reports; Allure / custom reporters | ✅ Built-in reporters; Allure / HTML / JSON / custom plugins | Both are capable; WDIO has more modern and flexible reporting options out-of-the-box. |
| **Community & Ecosystem** | ⭐⭐⭐ Mature Java ecosystem; enterprise support | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Active WDIO ecosystem; Appium plugins; strong JS/TS community | WDIO has faster growth, frequent plugin updates, and examples for mobile + visual testing. |


## Final choice WebdriverIo

While TestNG is a solid choice for Java-centric teams, WebdriverIO offers better support for parallelization, visual testing, cloud integration, modular architecture, and cross-platform consistency, making it the preferred runner/framework for our Appium-based white-label mobile automation strategy. Since our team is more familiar with js/ts it also makes a suitable choice because it will result in less dev cycle.
