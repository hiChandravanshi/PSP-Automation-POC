# Mobile Automation Tech stack POC

In this documnet we went throght different engines, frameworks, clouds and languages which are there and are widely used in mobile automation. We are comparing them side by side and finalizing the tools which are best for us as per our requirements which are:

- framework should be compatible for a white label application
- it should support cross platform (iOS and android)
- should work well with clouds like browserstack etc
- should support parallelization
- flexibilty for visual tests
- should support our team's tech compitancy which is js/ts based

## Final Choice (Appium)

After evaluating popular mobile automation frameworks against key criteria — cross-platform support, language flexibility, community support, CI/CD integration, execution speed, and visual testing capabilities — **Appium emerges as the most suitable choice** for our project.

Appium provides:

- **True cross-platform support** (iOS and Android) with a single codebase, reducing duplication and easing maintenance.  
- **Flexibility in programming languages**, allowing our team to leverage TypeScript/JavaScript for both mobile and web automation.  
- **Strong community and ecosystem**, ensuring long-term support, continuous updates, and integration with modern tools like BrowserStack.  
- **Seamless CI/CD and cloud device integration**, enabling parallel test execution and scalability.  
- **Compatibility with visual testing tools** like Applitools and Percy, which is crucial for maintaining white-label UI consistency across brands.

While native frameworks like Espresso and XCUITest offer faster execution and lower flakiness for platform-specific flows, Appium strikes the best balance between **cross-platform maintainability, cloud scalability, and visual verification support**, making it the ideal engine for our modular, white-label mobile application automation strategy.

## Java vs JS/TS

| Criteria                        | Java (Appium + TestNG/JUnit)                           | JavaScript / TypeScript (Appium + WebdriverIO)        | Winner 🏆                              |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| 🧱 Ecosystem & Tooling           | Mature, enterprise-grade tools (TestNG, JUnit, Gradle) | Modern tooling (WDIO, Cucumber, Allure, npm)          | Tie ⚖️                                 |
| 📱 React Native Compatibility    | Limited — not part of RN ecosystem                     | Excellent — same language as app layer                | JS/TS (FE is js/ts based)             |
| ⚙️ Appium Integration            | Stable Appium Java Client                              | Modern async/await support with WDIO Appium service   | Tie ⚖️                                 |
| 👥 Team Skill Alignment          | Not as familiar as with ts/js                          | Frontend (React Native) + QA both are friendly        | JS/TS (Team is more familiar)         |
| ☁️ BrowserStack Integration      | Excellent, but verbose config                          | Excellent — built-in WDIO BrowserStack service        | JS/TS (Easier to configure than java) |
| 🧩 Parallelization & Scalability | Supported via TestNG/Gradle                            | Built-in in WDIO (config-driven)                      | JS/TS (Easier to configure than java) |
| 🧪 BDD Support (Cucumber)        | Available                                              | Available                                             | Tie ⚖️                                 |

| ⚡ Execution Speed               | Slightly faster on Android                             | Slightly slower (async overhead) but negligible on BS | Tie ⚖️                                 |

**Conclusion:**

**Typescript (TS)** is the prefered language. It is a more familiar language with the current app frontend ecosystem which is react native (also JS/TS) based. The team is more competent on TS/JS as they are already familiar with syntex and architecture so it will result is less dev cycle. On performace basis their is not enough benchmarks which suggests that java based tools are far superior that the TS/JS based options.

| **TestNG**         | ✅ via Appium (iOS + Android + Hybrid)       | ❌ Java only             | ✅ Built-in support with suites / parallel execution | ✅ Jenkins, TeamCity, GitHub Actions, Azure                | ⚙️ Limited — can integrate with Applitools/third-party libraries | Popular in Java + Appium stacks; widely used in enterprise projects; less modern syntax compared to JS/TS runners |

Based on the data aquired and tabular comparison WebdriverIo and TestNg is the best suitable candidate for our application requirements.


## Final choice WebdriverIo

While TestNG is a solid choice for Java-centric teams, WebdriverIO offers better support for parallelization, visual testing, cloud integration, modular architecture, and cross-platform consistency, making it the preferred runner/framework for our Appium-based white-label mobile automation strategy. Since our team is more familiar with js/ts it also makes a suitable choice because it will result in less dev cycle.
